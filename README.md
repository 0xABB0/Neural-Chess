# Neural-Chess
Neural chess is an open source chess engine still in development.
To use it you need a winboard compatible GUI.

This project is still in development, it fully supports only "new" and "usermove", there are *a lot* of bugs and the neural network is still untrained.

## Libraries used:
* OpenNN
* Boost 1.67.0
* magic bits by goutham

## ToDo list:
* En Passant
* Finish castling
* Clean all the bugs still in the engine
* Finish implementing the Winboard protocol
* Implement the UCI protocol
* Train the neural network
* Try different types of neural network
* Opening books
* Using threads
* Implement configuration file
